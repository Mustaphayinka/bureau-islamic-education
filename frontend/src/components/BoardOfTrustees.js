            After the relocation from No. 2 Glover Road, Ikoyi Lagos to the permanent site at No. 17 Ruxton Road Ikoyi Lagos (which was later named the Abdulkadir Ahmed Islamic Centre), the Board of Trustees/Management Committee was chaired by Late Alhaji Abdulkadir Ahmed and in his absence Late Eng. Hamman Tukur was directed to chair all meetings at the time. In 1994, the Board of Trustees formally appointed Late Engineer Hamman Tukur to continue as chairman.
          </p>

            Due to the absence of the Members of the Board of Trustees in Lagos, the stakeholders established a Caretaker Management Committee, consisting of Islamic teachers and some members of the community, to run the affairs of the School and the Mosque. Late Alhaji A. G Aliyu was first appointed as chairman of that committee. After his death, AIG Alhaji Mu’azu Idris Hadeja was appointed, who was later succeeded by Late Brigadier General Aminu Maude and then Late Alhaji Mustapha Alkali. Alhaji Tjjani Borodo succeeded Late Mustapha Alkali, and in 2018, the Caretaker Management Committee was formally dissolved by the Board of Trustees headed by Late Alhaji (Ambassador) Adamu Muhammed. In the same year, new working documents (an amended Constitution, a Standard Operation Procedure, and a Condition of Service for Employees) were approved, and a Management Committee under the Chairmanship of Late Alhaji Mai Aliyu Muhammed was established.

            In 2024, a new Executive Management Committee (EXCO) was constituted/inaugurated under the Chairmanship of Alhaji Yusuf N’Jie.
